# Stockify
This project is a virtual game or platform that allows users to practice investing in the stock market without risking real money. The game simulates a stock market environment, with players buying and selling stocks and managing a virtual investment portfolio. Players would be given a virtual budget or a set amount of virtual money to start with, which they can use to buy stocks from a variety of companies listed on the virtual stock market. The game then tracks the performance of the stocks in the player's portfolio, allowing them to see how their investments are performing over time. The virtual stock market in the game is typically based on real-world stock market data and news, so players can learn how different economic events and news affect the stock market. Players can compete against each other in clans, with the objective of achieving the highest portfolio value at the end of the game.
Stock simulation games are a great way for novice investors to learn about the stock market without risking real money. They allow players to experiment with different investment strategies, learn how to read stock market charts and news, and gain a better understanding of the risks and rewards of investing in stocks.
